This system rushes 7 characters with no player involvement in game. Upon completing a set of 8 rushes you have 7x socket accounts.

Before each run you will need to change the kolbot profile to select the correct characters.



Set up:

1. Edit Rusher Config

	Change name and inventory settings.

2. Edit Rushee

	Change Leader Name

3. Edit Rushtread

	Find and replace 'charaa' with acc name. This makes the rusher say the character name of the character on the first account, making it the leader.

4. Edit Barbarian.Rushee

	Change Leader Name

5. Config Making:

	Open config maker folder.
	Edit copy.bat to reflect your char names
	This is complex or nitpicky, but you can work mostly with quick find and replaces
	Run copy.bat, cut and paste these configs into config folder

6. Edit profile.ini

	Insert your first seven account names and the first chars on these accounts
	Between each rush you will edit this file and increment to the next char with find and replace
	
7. Run Kolbot

	Set correct d2 path for all profiles.


Once set up, how to use:


1. Open Kolbot

2. Edit First Profile, click on the char name, close profile. There is a bug where if you don't do this it uses the char and acc name from the last time kolbot was run.

3. Launch all rushee's, then rusher.

4. When complete stop all profiles, close kolbot

5. Increment chars or accounts in profile.ini

6. If incremented account in profile.ini you must change rushtread so leader will be chosen


Issues:

Some times when a char is moving to act 3 from act 2 he is out of sync and his shown locations and his game server location are different. To resync he must move back to his game server location and he will suddenly do a tele thing. This requires manual fixing, happens like 1/5 games. While this char is still in act 2 the whole rush is held up.

Some times rusher fails to kill grand vizier, rare

Some times rushee fails to take diablo portal, rare
